Welcome to the RetroX E-commerce Project repository! This project is dedicated to bringing retro gaming enthusiasts a platform to find and purchase their favourite classic games, including titles from the SNES and Sega Genesis eras.

## Project Stages

### 1. Initial Stage
- In this stage, our focus is on setting the foundation for the e-commerce platform.

### 2. Prototype Development
- We will create a prototype to enable user interaction with the website, providing a preview of our platform's design and functionality.

### 3. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- The MVP will allow customers to:
  - Visualize products.
  - Add items to the cart without the need for registration.
  - Proceed to the checkout, where it will be necessary to create an account or log in.
  - Maintain a record of addresses and contact information.
  - Utilize various payment methods.
  - Access a history of their orders.
  - Have multiple communication channels with the website owner.

### 4. Future Plans
- After completing the first MVP, our roadmap includes:
  - Implementing a product rating and review system to gather user feedback.
  - Introducing a chatbot for instant assistance, enhancing customer support.

## Repository Information
